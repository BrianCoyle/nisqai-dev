# NISQAI

NISQAI is a library for quantum artificial intelligence on near-term quantum computers. For an overview of our project, please watch this short [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dOJ7Bhibec&t=1s). For more detailed information, please read our [project proposal](proposal/nisqai.pdf).

NISQAI is currently in development. The [examples](examples/) folder contains instructive notebooks on some of our ideas, such as our [one-qubit quantum classifier](examples/one-qubit-classifier/).

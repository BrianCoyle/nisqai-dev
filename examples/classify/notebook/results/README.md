# Description of Data/Results
This directory and the sub-directories within contain results obtained from
running the "one-qubit classifier" on different separation boundaries with
different numbers of data points.

For all results, points consist of random (x, y) coordinates in the unit square.

For all results, the "simple linear encoding"

\theta = \pi x
\phi = 2 \pi y

is used.

The sub-directory "linear-sep" contains results for linear separation boundaries,
for example the vertical line x = 0.5 y or the line y = x.

The subdirectory "nonlinear-sep" contains results for non-linear separation boundaries,
for example the circle with radius 0.25 centered at x = y = 0.5.
